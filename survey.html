          <h3 id="keyfindings" class="mt-5">Key Findings</h3>

          <ul class="mt-3">
            <li>
              The main draw of social media is the utility it gives people to
              stay connected to people and communities that they deem important.
            </li>
            <li>
              People's primary complaint about social media isn&#8217;t the
              technology itself, but how other humans interact and behave on the
              platforms.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Social media users want more tools and control over what they see,
              in part to mitigate the negative behaviours of other users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users want a platform that helps them parse misleading or unwanted
              content.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="part2" class="mt-5">Why Do People Use Social Media?</h2>

          <p>
            Overwhelmingly, people use social media platforms to stay connected
            to family and friends and participate in various communities. Survey
            respondents also cited social media as a place to find entertainment
            and information on personal interests and news. A minority of
            respondents reported using social media to share their opinions.
          </p>

          <p>
            People&#8217;s responses on why they used social media were broadly
            consistent with what they liked and disliked about the platforms.
            Respondents cited a connection with friends and family as the main
            reason they enjoyed social media.&nbsp; Negative behaviours and
            opinions were the primary frustrations users had with existing
            social media platforms.

            How Do People Currently Use Social Media
          </h2>

          <p>
            Answers to closed questions were used to collect information on what
            social media platforms people used and how they interacted with
            existing platforms. The survey responses indicate that people use
            multiple social media platforms every day, and they perform a wide
            range of tasks on the platforms currently available.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-5">What social media platforms are used?</h3>

          <p>
            Among respondents,
            <strong>FaceBook</strong>
            is the most popular social media platform currently in use. But, as
            I only recruited survey respondents from FaceBook and Instagram
            (which doesn&#8217;t allow direct links) this data might be skewed a
            bit. The majority of respondents had to be on FaceBook to access the
            survey.

          <p>
            All respondents reported using at least two platforms. Using
            <strong>three to six</strong>
            different platforms was most common among surveyors.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-fs-light">What devices do they use?</h3>

          <p>
            Respondents preferred to access their platforms on portable devices,
            with mobile devices being the most popular device either via a web
            browser or a dedicated app.
          </p>

            What do people do on social media platforms?

            Interaction types fall into three broad categories:
            <strong>
              posting original content, posting found content and responding to
              content
            </strong>
            . Users slightly favoured responding to content and posting original
            material interactions to posting found material interactions.
          </p>

            Photos are the most popular original content to post. Written
            articles are the most popular found content to post, and respondents
            have a clear preference for commenting and liking content to other
            forms of content interaction.

          <p>
            A sizable minority of users have a business, side hustle or side
            project they promote on social media, but most respondents are
            interacting with the platform as individual users.

          <p>
            All respondents were daily users of social media, with most
            respondents checking their platforms five or more times a day. While
            &#8216;not every day&#8217; was listed as a choice in the survey no
            one selected that option.

          <h2 id="part4" class="mt-5">How Do People Feel About Social Media</h2>

          <p>
            Responses to open-ended questions have been collected, analyzed and
            placed in broad categories to determine how survey respondents
            <strong>feel</strong>
            about various aspects of social media.
          </p>

          <p>
            Questions were placed at the beginning of the survey to ensure
            respondents were not fatigued while answering, or biased in any way
            by the selection of closed questions that followed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interestingly, people had a wide variety of frustrations with social
            media, but most were attracted to the idea for the same reason.

            When asked
            <strong>&#8220;What do you like about social media?&#8221;</strong>
            , respondents overwhelmingly indicated that social media&#8217;s
            ability to keep them connected to family and friends was a primary
            draw.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Many responses also saw social media&#8217;s ability to foster

            Many users mentioned several different positive aspects of social

            What frustrates people about social media?
          </h3>

          <p>
            When asked
            <strong>
              &#8220;What frustrates you about social media?&#8221;
            </strong>
            users had a range of complaints, but the most frequent answer was to
            exhibit frustration with the negative behaviours of other platform
            users. Other frustrations described irrelevant content, privacy and
            security concerns, and voiced opinions.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>

            <strong>toxic</strong>

            were often used to describe other social media users.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Advertising was one of the other main points of frustration,
            particularly when users thought ads were replacing content they
            might want to see.
            <strong>
              <em>

          <p>
            Similar to answers about what users liked about social media
            respondents often listed several frustrations or dislikes.
            Misinformation, or fake news, was mentioned frequently.

              media site, what would it be?&#8221;

            most requested improvements to existing features and functionality
            over novel new uses for social media.
          </p>

          <p>
            There were some requests for completely new or underdeveloped

            <strong><em>&#8220;philanthropy</em></strong>
            <em>&#8220;</em>

            <strong>.&nbsp;</strong>
            Overall, answers seem more concerned with improving the
            functionality social media currently provides and minimizing some
            aforementioned frustrations like ad blocking and privacy concerns.
          </p>

          <p>

            or
            <strong><em>&#8220;better photo organization&#8221;</em></strong>

            or
            <strong><em>“Not Sure”</em></strong>
            which suggests that a new survey question needs to be written to
            replace it in future uses of this survey. A full 19% of data was
            unusable.&nbsp;

          <h2 id="conclusions" class="mt-5">Conclusions &amp; Next Steps</h2>

          <p>
            Survey respondents already make daily use of multiple social media
            platforms. There does not seem to be an appetite for a new platform,
            despite many frustrations with current offerings. For a new platform
            to gain traction it would have to elegantly address the major
            frustrations mentioned by survey respondents.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-light mt-5">Next Steps</h3>

          <p>
            If I were to move forward with this project I would first want to
            conduct more research in the following areas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              What are the most popular revenue models currently in use that are
              not ad dependant? Can one of them be applied to a social media
              platform?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there databases, AI or APIs out there that can help flag
              questionable content based on the source URL or text analysis? Can
              they be easily integrated into a social media platform?
            </li>
            <li>
              Look at behavioural psychology on group dynamics. Is there a way
              to design a site that naturally encourages positive interactions
              over mean or trolling ones? Have studies been done in analog
              situations that might be adapted to digital platforms?&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I&#8217;d also perform some user tests on current social media sites
            to see how the existing UI patterns for interactions like search,
            hiding ads and unwanted content are working. How long do they take
            to find? Are they buried under other features? Do they even exist on
            mobile versions of the site?
          </p>

          <p>
            Assuming I found encouraging answers in my second round of research,
            I&#8217;d design a &#8216;mobile first&#8217; wire-frame and test it
            out on a small group of people to see how it works. Then I&#8217;d
            conduct another round of surveys to gauge how respondents feel about
            paying for social media access and whatever other potential issues I
            uncover.
