<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<p>FretHero is a side project. I am endeavouring to fully understand all aspects of digital product development, from concept to development to launch and marketing.</p>

<p><b>Timeline:</b> 7 weeks from concept to Figma Prototype</p>
<p><b>Platform:</b> Andriod App.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Constraints: </b><br>
<ul>
<li>No budget</li>
<li>Just Me. </li>
</p>

<h2>The Problem: </h2>
<p>How do you help adult guitar students, who are short on time, memorize the fretboard, note and chord theory to move from beginner to intermediate guitar players?</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>During the pandemic, I dusted off the guitar that had spent two decades hiding under my bed and began the slow process of relearning the instrument. I was not alone, all major guitar brands and music retailers recorded record-breaking sales in 2020, and online learning Apps and YouTube instructors reported a massive increase in subscribers.</p>

<p>I was also looking for an idea I could take from concept to design and eventually into development and marketing to gain a comprehensive understanding of every aspect of digital product creation.  Developing a guitar learning App seemed like a relevant project to take on. There is currently a strong desire for digital learning tools for guitar and not many available solutions.</p> 

<h2>Initial Research</h2>
<p>Fretboard note memorization is where most people plateau when learning the guitar, as it is tedious and dull. My research investigated different ways to make the learning process seem fun and engaging.</p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>The goal of fretboard memorization and studying scales is to gain instant recall of the notes on the fretboard and how the notes relate to scales and chords. While several fretboard learning Apps are already available, <b>none are designed to encourage recall over recognition</b>. Most have static and unengaging interfaces. Essentially acting more as digital flashcards than a fully interactive user experience.</p>

<h2>Microlearning Design</h2>
<p>I read several articles on micro-learning, and the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve to gain a better understanding of how to design short micro-learning sessions. I learned that creating quick, interactive training sessions around one key point is key to creating a successful microlearning syllabus.</p>

<h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>Game mechanics in Apps currently available seem designed around randomness. But randomness does not promote learning or understanding.  Many videos and articles online describe different methods to memorize the scales and notes on the fretboard.  All these systems are highly visual, good news for someone creating a visual UI. I noted several memorization systems for future reference when it came to designing and programming the game mechanics. </p>

<h2>App Design & Development</h2>
<p>Having never created an App before, I looked into Andriod and iPhone's development process and design systems. I settled on Andriod development as there are no upfront costs associated with app development (this is a side project).  At the time of writing, the App was set to be built in Kotlin as the language is truly native to Andriod and offers the best performance and a fluid UX experience. </p>

<h2>User Flows & Initial Sketches</h2>


<p>My design process started with a bulleted list of the functionality I wanted the App to have. This ended up being a very long wish-list, that I parred down to bare essentials that would form the Minimum Viable Product.</p>

<p>From there, I sketched out four main user flows for Initial Onboarding, Performing a Training Session, Reviewing User Progress and Recording a Video and made low-fidelity sketches of the key screens. The sketches were cleaned up and refined in Figma then linked together into an initial prototype for round one of user testing. </p>

<h2>Initial User Tests</h2>
<p>I arranged for 3 user tests on participants who represented a range of ages and musical education, but only one had experience playing guitar and reading chord boxes. Despite these limitations, each test participant understood what the purpose of the App was. They all intuitively knew how to input answers to all three types of training questions, which was very encouraging.</p>

<p>Three main points were uncovered at this stage:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The Video and History icons in the navigation bar were misinterpreted</li>
<li>The ability to name a saved video was overlooked (big oops!)
The copy in the Training results area was unclear or not detailed enough.</li>
</ul>

<h2>High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p>Stylistically, I wanted something minimal, offering only essential visuals to the user for easy memorization. At the same time, the App had to vibe with music lovers and students and be fun to use. I assembled a mood board for inspiration. I found myself attracted to music illustrations that made use of white space, abstract shapes and colour.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the high fidelity wires, I did more reading into App design specifications and navigation labels.  My initial designs were portrait, but that meant the tap points on my fretboard UI would be too small on the smallest screens and create usability issues. Not wanting users to flip their phones within the App experience, I redesigned all my screens for landscape orientation and was pleased to find that the results opened up all my designs, which had felt cramped in portrait mode.</p>

<p>I also moved the secondary navigation into a hamburger menu. This meant I could provide an icon and clear label to each section without distracting the user from the primary function of the App, the gaming options. </p>

<h2>Further Testing & Refinement</h2>
<p>I ran the second round of testing on Maze, soliciting 24 testers.</p>

<p>These tests validated that I had fixed my initial navigation and labelling issues</p>
<ul>
<li><b>90% of testers</b> rated the App navigation experience as a 7 out of 10 or higher.</li>
<li><b>100% of testers</b> stated the icons and labels on the menu screen made sense to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The heatmaps revealed some minor confusion over the buttons, which are white on white. I may have gone a bit too minimal here. The back button in the practice sessions was not always intuitive, although the icon size and placement followed Material Designs practices.</p>

<p>I added colour to the inactive buttons and highlighted the back arrow with animation.  These adjustments make the buttons stand out quickly as the user travels through the App. </p> 

<p>Concurrent research into URL availability revealed that FretMaster is taken, so the project was renamed FretHero.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>At this point, I am confident the FretHero UI and general interface are usable, and I think there is a viable market for this project.  I've put together a simple business model and am in the process of flowcharting specific game mechanics.</p>
