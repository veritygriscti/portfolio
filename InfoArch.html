<p>I’m currently enrolled in York University’s School of Continuing Studies <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://continue.yorku.ca/certificates/ux-design/" target="_blank">UX Design Certificate</a>. For the introductory class, we were asked to generate a list of 100 random things from the website <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.randomlists.com/things" target="_blank">Random Lists</a> and create an organization scheme for the items along with an explanation of how we arrived at that scheme. </p>



<h2><strong>Organizational Process</strong></h2>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Part 1: Try to Be Cute </strong></h3>



<p>I wrote all my items out on individual index cards and started sorting. Initially, I liked the idea of fitting all the objects into the general schema of a house. Having parent categories being rooms in a home: bathroom, kitchen etc. and sub-categories representing specific places within each room: pantry, utility closet etc. In order for this schema to work, I had to make some leaps of logic, placing the <strong>sailboat </strong>in the garage. I put the <strong>drill press</strong> in the basement, in hindsight that seems very random. I also couldn&#8217;t properly address objects that might be in multiple rooms in the house, like <strong>a lamp </strong>or <strong>mirror</strong>. I abandoned this idea while trying to rationalize how <strong>street lights</strong> could belong in a den or home bar as it became apparent I was trying too hard to shoehorn too many of the items into my &#8216;house&#8217; idea simply because I liked it.</p>



<h3><strong>Part 2: Let Objects Dictate the Organization</strong></h3>



<p>I did another open sort, this time grouping the items solely as I thought they related to each other. I came up with 12 parent categories and 10 sub-categories diagrammed below.</p>

<h3><strong>Part 3: Closed Sorts Test</strong></h3>



<p>I had my husband and 9-year-old daughter perform closed sorts, grouping objects into my predefined categories and sub-categories, to see if my schema made sense to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong> My daughter didn&#8217;t know where to put <strong>sidewalk </strong>and <strong>street lights </strong>because she didn&#8217;t know what <strong>Neighbourhood Infrastructure </strong>meant. She also asked what <strong>appliances </strong>meant. So, my IA is not going to be accessible to all ages and reading levels as it currently stands and I can&#8217;t just assume it&#8217;s good for all English speaking user groups.</p>



<p><strong>Observation 2: </strong>&nbsp;I opted for words without pictures when I generated my list and some of the items could be interpreted quite differently. My daughter sorted the <strong>controller </strong>into <strong>Recreation &gt; Games </strong>because she thought it was about a video game controller and reasoned the controller belonged with the <strong>video game</strong>. I had it sorted with<strong> Home Electronics &amp; Appliances</strong> because I assumed it was a television controller, but now that I think of it that device is usually called a &#8216;remote&#8217;<strong>, </strong>not a controller. Either way, <strong>Home Electronics</strong> is probably the better home for that item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Less clear, my Husband sorted <strong>bow </strong>in with <strong>Clothing &gt; Accessories</strong> because he thought it referenced a &#8216;bow-tie&#8217;. I sorted the <strong>bow </strong>into <strong>Recreations &gt; Outdoors </strong>because I automatically thought the word referred to an archery bow, but it could also be a gift-wrap bow. Those are 3 very different objects with 3 very different homes in my IA.</p>



<p>I went back over my 100 items. Many are super-specific: <strong>plastic fork</strong>, <strong>fake flowers</strong>, <strong>soy sauce packet</strong> etc, but quite a few (<strong>bow</strong>, <strong>needle</strong>, <strong>cork </strong>etc) are vague and the word will mean different things to different people. <strong>Teddies</strong> could be a reference to multiple stuffed bears, but it could just as easily be a reference to lingerie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Part 4: Provide More Descriptive Names to Ambiguous Items</strong></h3>



<p>If I was sorting 100 real objects I would go back verify what they actually are and add more descriptive wording as necessary. I can&#8217;t do that here, I didn&#8217;t even generate pictures that I can cross-reference.  I could rely on context. If you see a <strong>bow </strong>in <strong>Recreation&gt;Outdoors </strong>you&#8217;ll easily deduce it&#8217;s an archery bow. But if you&#8217;re running Tree Testing, where the user has to find a <strong>bow </strong>it&#8217;s better for the user&#8217;s cognitive load if the text is more descriptive, because scanning organizational hierarchies and making deductions takes time and effort. Also, if I change or expand my IA and list items it would be better for maintenance if I use more reliable descriptions from the start. What if I add an R/C Car controller or dish-washing soap or something similar later on?</p>



<p>I went back and lightly edited my list of items where I thought there might be some confusion. My edits are in italics below:</p>



<ol><li><em>bath </em>towel</li><li>twister <em>floor game</em></li><li>teddies<em>, lingerie</em></li><li><em>sewing </em>needle</li><li><em>archery  </em>bow</li><li><em>electronics </em>charger</li><li><em>computer </em>monitor</li><li><em>drinking </em>glass</li><li><em>gaming </em>controller</li><li><em>bar </em>soap</li><li><em>coat </em>hanger</li><li><em>computer </em>keyboard</li><li><em>wine </em>cork</li><li><em>shirt </em>button</li></ol>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s cheating but I&#8217;m going to rationalize that it isn&#8217;t because the W3C wants wording on websites to be descriptive and accurate so people using screen readers can easily understand the content. If a sighted person needs a picture of a bow, controller or needle to confirm exactly what object it is then a sight-impaired person is going to need the alt text description of that image to be more descriptive too.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Part 5: Consolidate Categories, Expanded Sub-Categories</strong></h3>



<p>After I was done reviewing the descriptions of the items I took another look at my categories. 12 top-level categories seemed like a lot and the descriptions of some of the categories were weak and led to questions during the card sorting test. I ended up making 8 broader top-level categories and 16 sub-categories. I tried to make them more descriptive.  </p>

<h3><strong>Part 6: Re-test</strong></h3>



<p>I had my husband and daughter redo the closed sort test, sorting the cards into my new categories and sub-categories. There were no misinterpretations of the items this time around. There were still slight variations on where we sorted things. I put packing peanuts in <strong>Industrial</strong>, my husband put it in <strong>Household Items &gt; Cleaning &amp; Organization. </strong>I put the <strong>wine cork</strong> and <strong>bottle cap </strong>in <strong>Household Items &gt; Kitchen. </strong>&nbsp;My husband placed them in the broader <strong>Household Items</strong> category. My daughter thought I needed a new category called <strong>junk.&nbsp; </strong>But other than these small differences the 2nd closed sorts went quickly and smoothly. So with a small addition of the subcategory of <strong>shipping materials </strong>added to <strong>Industrial Use </strong>and changing <strong>Outdoor Use &gt; Recreation</strong> to<strong> Outdoor Use &gt; Outdoor Play </strong>I&#8217;ve got my final organization schema mapped out.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>



<p>I think the final organizational layout is logical, although I can see other ways to group things that might be better or more intuitive. It&#8217;s hard to tell with my sample size of 3. <strong>Personal Hygiene</strong> products might be better as a top level category. <strong>Appliances </strong>might be better as a subcategory of <strong>Household Items</strong> instead of lumping it in with electronics. I think running some tree tests and seeing how quickly users find the items, seeing if there are patterns of behaviour in where they look and tweaking the schema based on the results would be the next step in this process.</p>

<h2><strong>Afterword</strong> </h2>



<p>After this assignment was handed in it was brought up that almost no one just goes straight to organizing the random things <strong><em>alphabetically</em></strong>.  </p>



<p>I thought that was an interesting point because it didn&#8217;t even occur to me to create an alphabetical schema. I think it&#8217;s because the last time I encountered IA where the top level hierarchy was alphabetical it was either in the very early days of the web or the world of analogue. I&#8217;m thinking back to the time of Phone books, Map Indexes, Card Catalogues and the Shelf of Encyclopedias. If you know what you&#8217;re looking for it&#8217;s a solid system, but maybe not as effective as the search bar, which seems to have replaced alphabetization in a lot of ways. But it&#8217;s not a system that encourages discover-ability. No one walks into a book store and goes, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m a Hemingway fan so I bet I love Herman Hesse because he&#8217;s also in the H&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve just gotten use to being able to browse by topic and follow rabbit holes of hyperlinks. Whereas before when I needed to find information I already had to at least vaguely know what I was looking for. It&#8217;s interesting how quickly I&#8217;ve gone in my life time from just assuming I&#8217;ll find something alphabetically to not even thinking to arrange something alphabetically. </p>



<p>While researching different analogue information systems for contrast I ran across this article in Time,<a href="https://time.com/5904883/alphabetical-order-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> From Encyclopedias to Telephone Books, How Alphabetization Took Over the Modern World</a>.  The story behind many of the things we take for granted is always fascinating.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently enrolled in York University&#8217;s School of Continuing Studies <a href="https://continue.yorku.ca/certificates/ux-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UX Design Certificate</a>. For the introductory class, we were asked to conduct a 10 question survey on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-t5nFc2JSDIdVV15qDEhFHPFP_exBxLCW5vO-jUTSlc6YYw/viewform">Google Forms</a>&nbsp;to gauge public perception of existing social media platforms to gain a high-level sense of how people use, and what they think, of current social media offerings.</p>



<p>This summary report analyzes the data collected from <strong>47 respondents</strong>.</p>



<div id="intro">



<ol><li><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#why">Why do people use social media?</a></li><li><a href="#how">How people currently use social media?</a></li><li><a href="#feel">How do people feel about social media?</a></li><li><a href="#new">Openness to joining a new social media platform.</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusions</a></li></ol>



<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Key Findings:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The main draw of social media is the utility it gives people to stay connected to people and communities that they deem important.</li><li>Peoples primary complaint about social media isn&#8217;t the technology itself, but how other humans interact and behave on the platforms.&nbsp;</li><li>Social media users want more tools and control over what they see, in part to mitigate the negative behaviours of other users.</li><li>Users want a platform that helps them parse misleading or unwanted content.</li></ul>



<h2 id="why"><strong>Why do people use social media?</strong></h2>



<p>Overwhelmingly people use social media platforms to stay connected to family and friends and participate in various communities. Survey respondents also cited social media as a place to find entertainment and information on personal interests and news. A minority of respondents reported using social media to share their opinions.</p>



<p>People&#8217;s responses on why they used social media were broadly consistent with what they liked and disliked about the platforms. Respondents cited a connection with friends and family as the main reason they enjoyed social media.&nbsp; Negative behaviours and opinions were the primary frustrations users had with existing social media platforms.</p>

<h2 id="how"><strong>How people currently use social media.&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Answers to closed questions were used to collect information on what social media platforms people used and how they interacted with existing platforms. The survey responses indicate that people use multiple social media platforms every day, and they perform a wide range of tasks on the platforms currently available.</p>



<h3><strong>What social media platforms are used?</strong></h3>

<p></p>



<p>Among respondents, <strong>FaceBook </strong>is the most popular social media platform currently in use. But, as I only recruited survey respondents from FaceBook and Instagram (which doesn&#8217;t allow direct links) this data might be skewed a bit. The majority of respondents had to be on FaceBook to access the survey.</p>

Number of Social Media platforms used by Survey Respondents.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>All respondents reported using at least two platforms. Using <strong>three to six</strong> different platforms was most common among surveyors.</p>



<h3><strong>What devices do they use?</strong></h3>



<p>Respondents preferred to access their platforms on portable devices, with mobile devices being the most popular device either via a web browser or a dedicated app.</p>

Types of devices used by survey respondents to access social media.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>What do people do on social media platforms?</strong></h3>



<p>Interaction types fall into three broad categories: <strong>posting original content, posting found content and responding to content</strong>. Users slightly favoured responding to content and posting original material interactions to posting found material interactions. </p>

Three primary social interaction types performed by survey respondents</figcaption></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>Photos are the most popular original content to post. Written articles are the most popular found content to post, and respondents have a clear preference for commenting and liking content to other forms of content interaction.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Use vs. Business Use</strong></h3>



<p>A sizable minority of users have a business, side hustle or side project they promote on social media, but most respondents are interacting with the platform as individual users.</p>

<h3><strong>How often do people check social media?</strong></h3>



<p>All respondents were daily users of social media. With most respondents checking their platforms five or more times a day. While &#8216;not every day&#8217; was listed as a choice in the survey no one selected that option.</p>

<h2 id="feel"><strong>How do people feel about social media?</strong></h2>



<p>Responses to open-ended questions have been collected, analyzed and placed in broad categories to determine how survey respondents <strong>feel </strong>about various aspects of social media. </p>



<p>Questions were placed at the beginning of the survey to ensure respondents were not fatigued while answering, or biased in any way by the selection of closed questions that followed.</p>



<p>Interestingly, people had a wide variety of frustrations with social media, but most were attracted to the idea for the same reason.</p>



<h3><strong>What do people like about social media?</strong></h3>



<p>When asked <strong>&#8220;What do you like about social media?&#8221;</strong>, respondents overwhelmingly indicated that social media&#8217;s ability to keep them connected to family and friends was a primary draw.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;I like being able to connect with my friends and family and see their updates on their lives&#8221;&nbsp; </em></strong>or <strong><em>&#8220;Mostly I like seeing pictures of what my friends are up to, particularly now&#8221;</em></strong> were typical responses to the question prompt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many responses also saw social media&#8217;s ability to foster community as a big positive. Answers that talked about community were among the most<em> </em>positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;</em><strong><em>Seeing photos and updates about my family and friends. I’ve met a lot of people with common interests who I probably never would have crossed path with if it wasn’t for social media.&#8221;&nbsp; </em></strong>or<strong> </strong><strong><em>&#8220;Ability to stay connected with people and have a worldwide community.&#8221;</em></strong><strong> </strong>are examples of responses that positively mention community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many users mentioned several different positive aspects of social media in their answers. These users viewed social media as an enjoyable way to access information, for entertainment or other purposes, alongside the ability to let them connect to people.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;Entertainment. Seeing new ideas, and what my friends are up to.&#8221;</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>or <strong><em>&#8220;Humour, hearing from friends (actual real world friends) amusing animal videos, looking at art</em></strong><strong>&#8221; </strong>&nbsp;are examples of people who are drawn to social media for several different reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall words like <strong>friends</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, <strong>connection </strong>and <strong>easy </strong>where the most used by respondents when asked what they liked about social media.</p>

<h3><strong>What frustrates people about social media?</strong></h3>



<p>When asked <strong>&#8220;What frustrates you about social media?&#8221; </strong>users had a range of complaints, but the most frequent answer was to exhibit frustration with the negative behaviours of other platform users. Other frustrations described irrelevant content, privacy and security concerns, and voiced opinions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;It can be very toxic in how people interact and bully each other on it.&#8221; </em></strong>and <strong><em>&#8220;Negative and toxic people.&#8221; </em></strong>are examples of survey responses that indicated the behaviours of other users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Words like <strong>annoying</strong>, <strong>stupid</strong>, <strong>toxic </strong>and <strong>moron </strong>were often used to describe other social media users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advertising was one of the other main points of frustration, particularly when users thought ads were replacing content they might want to see. <strong><em>&#8220;The algorithms that force products down my throat or promote the daily spam and click bait fluff articles that drown out my timeline.&#8221;</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>is how one user explained this frustration.</p>



<p>Similar to answers about what users liked about social media respondents often listed several frustrations or dislikes. Misinformation, or fake news, was mentioned frequently. <strong><em>&#8220;Misinformation and extreme rudeness. &#8220;</em></strong> and<strong> </strong><strong><em>&#8220;Too many ads, too much fake news, too much hacking&#8221; </em></strong>were typical responses of this type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, words like <strong>ads</strong>, <strong>misinformation</strong>, <strong>negativity</strong>, <strong>fake</strong>, <strong>opinion </strong>and <strong>stupid </strong>were used the most by respondents.</p>

<h3><strong>Improvements over New Features</strong></h3>



<p>When survey takers were asked, <strong>&#8220;If you could add a new feature to your favourite social media site, what would it be?&#8221; </strong>most requested improvements to existing features and functionality over novel new uses for social media.</p>



<p>There were some requests for completely new or underdeveloped features like <strong><em>&#8220;philanthropy</em></strong><em>&#8220;</em>, the <strong><em>&#8220;ability to play music with others&#8221;</em></strong><strong> </strong>or <strong><em>&#8220;Live Q&amp;A&#8221;</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>Overall, answers seem more concerned with improving the functionality social media currently provides and minimizing some aforementioned frustrations like ad blocking and privacy concerns.</p>



<p>Answers like<strong> </strong><strong><em>&#8220;unbury logout button&#8221;</em></strong> or<strong> </strong><strong><em>&#8220;better search&#8221;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8220;better photo organization&#8221;</em></strong> were the most common. Respondents also requested more control over the content they saw and shared asking for<em> </em><strong><em>&#8220;A more personalized content feed&#8221;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&#8220;limiting screen shares and comments&#8221; </em></strong>among other requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high number of people answered this question with answers like <strong><em>“IDK”</em></strong> or<strong> <em>“Not Sure”</em> </strong>which suggests that a new survey question needs to be written to replace it in future uses of this survey. A full 19% of data was unusable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="new"><strong>Open to joining a new social media platform?</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the range of frustrations described by survey respondents, people seem neutral to reluctant on the idea of joining a new platform.</p>



<p>When given a quantitative likert question asking how likely they were to join a new social media platform users seemed neutral to against it.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="379" data-permalink="https://artmeetsgeekcom.wordpress.com/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1/" data-orig-file="https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png" data-orig-size="600,371" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png?w=600" src="https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-379" srcset="https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png 600w, https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png?w=150 150w, https://artmeetsgeekcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/how-likely-are-you-to-join-a-new-social-media-platform-1-1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Fig. 14  Survey respondents likert responses to joining a new social media platform. 1 = unlikely and 5= definitely.</figcaption></figure></div>

<h2 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>



<p>Survey respondents already make daily use of multiple social media platforms. There does not seem to be an appetite for a new platform, despite many frustrations with current offerings. For a new platform to gain traction it would have to elegantly address the major frustrations mentioned by survey respondents.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>



<p>If I were to move forward with this project I would first want to conduct more research in the following areas:</p>



<ul><li>What are the most popular revenue models currently in use that are not ad dependant? Can one of them be applied to a social media platform?</li><li>Are there databases, AI or APIs out there that can help flag questionable content based on the source URL or text analysis? Can they be easily integrated into a social media platform?</li><li>Look at behavioural psychology on group dynamics. Is there a way to design a site that naturally encourages positive interactions over mean or trolling ones? Have studies been done in analogue situations that might be adapted to digital platforms?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;d also perform some user tests on current social media sites to see how the existing UI patterns for interactions like search, hiding ads and unwanted content are working. How long do they take to find? Are they buried under other features? Do they even exist on mobile versions of the site?</p>



<p>Assuming I found encouraging answers in my second round of research, I&#8217;d design a &#8216;mobile first&#8217; wire-frame and test it out on a small group of people to see how it works. Then I&#8217;d conduct another round of surveys to gauge how respondents feel about paying for social media access and whatever other potential issues I uncover.</p>
